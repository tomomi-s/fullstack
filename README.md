# Assignment

We've put together a tiny assignment to get a bit of a better idea of your development experience and style. The general idea is that we would like to see an interface with animals (bears 🐻, dogs 🐶 and cats 🐱) listed based on the data provided in `data.json`.

For the frontend, we would like to see a React app. You are free to choose your own approach to things like setup, styling, state management and anything else you might need. A short motivation will of course be appreciated, but is not required.

For the backend you're free to choose a technology you're comfortable with, but internally we use mostly Scala and some NodeJS.

## Requirements

Based around the data provided, create a web app and API that support the following functionality:

- An interface that shows a list of animals with their details (name / image / species), sorted by name.
- An endpoint that returns these animals to the frontend.
- A selector that allows you to filter the animals based on their species (bear 🐻 / dog 🐶 / cat 🐱).

If you have any questions or if anything is unclear, do not hesitate to get in touch.
